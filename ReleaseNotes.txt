Release 1.6.1 - 24 Jan 2016
===========================================================================

Moqui Runtime 1.6.1 is the first release of the runtime repository separate
from the rest of Moqui Framework.

Version numbers of this repository will match those of moqui-framework, the
two are developed in parallel. They are separate to make it easier to use
your runtime directory separate from the rest of the framework (for
configuration, custom UI, etc). The easiest way to do this is generally to
fork from this repository (moqui/moqui-runtime).
